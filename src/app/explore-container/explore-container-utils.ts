    answer: {
      c: 'Enteric-coated tablets resist disintegration in the acidic environment of the stomach and disintegrate when they reach the small intestine. There is usually some delay in onset of actions after taking these medications. Enteric-coated tablets should not be crushed or chewed, which would alter the time and location of absorption.

      c: 'Insulin, growth hormones, and other protein-based drugs are destroyed in the small intestine by digestive enzymes and must be given parenterally. Because insulin is destroyed by digestive enzymes, it would not make it to the liver for metabolism with a first-pass effect. Subcutaneous tissue has fewer blood vessels, so absorption is slower in such tissue. Insulin is given subcutaneously because it is desirable to have it absorb slowly.',
